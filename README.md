### About me

Chong Zhou is currently PhD student, in the College of Computer Scinece, China Unviersity of Geosciences, Wuhan, from 2015/9 to  date.

### News
 A paper is coming soon...
 
### Research Interest

My main research interest is evolutionary computation, multiobjective optimizaiton, meta-heuristic algorithms, machine learing and their applications in real-world problems. Recently, I am focusing upon designing evoluationary algorithm for Many-objective optimization problem.
